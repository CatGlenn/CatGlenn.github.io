When I first began learning to code on the Learn platform, my instructor warned me about the trap of Imposter Syndrome.  She told me that many beginner students, especially women, can struggle with self-doubt when starting out.  I was incredibly relieved to hear this, because I have struggled with this kind of self-doubt on pretty much every new venture I have encountered in my young adult life.  Starting college, beginning different jobs, and even learning how to drive were all scenarios where I had to prove myself wrong through diligent practice.  Coding is proving no different.  Sometimes I really feel like a complete fraud when I sign on to Learn, looking at the different students progressing at different levels, as I wonder why the heck I thought I could do this.  But those are the moments that produce the most growth.  If I can push through my own mental roadblocks, I can accomplish almost anything.  So it's nice for me to remind myself of that periodically, especially during these long winter months!
