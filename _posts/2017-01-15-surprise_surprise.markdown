'We already KNOW about coding,' I heard one of my 8th grade students mutter under her breath after I assigned the day's activity.  *Really*, I thought.  *You know everything there is to know about computer science, sure*.  My students do know a lot about it, however.  As a first year computers teacher, I have made a strong emphasis on the importance of coding in all of my classes.  Though at the start of the year I didn't know too much about computer science, I knew conveying its importance to my students was going to be the center of my planning.  What I didn't anticipate, though, was falling in love with the subject myself. 


Teaching Computers classes has been an interesting challenge, especially since my Bachelor of Arts degree in History is not exactly the best training for a tech job.  I knew I wanted to spend this year teaching, and I knew I wanted to serve at a school on a reservation.  The Red Cloud Indian School Volunteer program was the perfect fit, and they needed someone with experience with younger children to teach computers classes.  The curriculum was adaptable and easy for a beginner to take on, and so I accepted the position not quite knowing what to expect.  

I chose to pursue the Full Stack Web Development program because as I have been learning more and more about computer science for my classes, I have fallen in love with the creativity of the subject and the endless possibilities it generates.  I have emphasized this importance to my students ad nauseam (they would be quick to assure you of that).  I ended up convincing myself to pursue a future in computer science as well.
