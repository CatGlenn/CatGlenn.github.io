Once, in college, I attended a leadership seminar for prospective RA's that I had extremely low expectations for.  I have been to several of these mostly-cliched-vague-platitude-spewing events to encourage me to "be my best self," "shoot for the stars," "don't let anything stop you" kind of training sessions.  While they did always contain some pieces of useful knowledge, most of the time I would leave thinking that what I learned could have easily been distilled into a few bullet points and sent via PDF to the whole staff. 
 
 So, I was pleasantly surprised when the night's seminar on "Time Management" had a boat load of practical tips, suggestions, and ways of thinking about using time to benefit yourself.  One speaker compared a lot of Dave Ramsey's famous financial advice to time - if you budget it well, your time serves you! You don't have to be a slave to your schedule! It was wonderful.  The speaker went through different examples of how to organize your planner, section off mods of time in color coded blocks, whatever works best for you. 
 
 Years later, I find myself realizing I need to revisit those topics.  If I am going to balance a full time (sometimes "Fuller Time" as I like to put it) job, a move halfway across the country NEXT MONTH (GULP!) and transitioning into a NEW job, while managing these (so wonderful) online courses, I need to overhaul my schedule.  
 
Maybe tonight I'll have a sit down with myself: grab a cup of coffee, stare in the mirror, throw a few affirmations in my own direction, then reorganize my planner.  And then I'll code something awesome.
