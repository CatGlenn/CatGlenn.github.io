I have only been coding for a few weeks, but I have already noticed how the lessons I have learned on the computer can translate to my daily life.  The educational system I spent the majority of my life in has taught me to view failure as a negative reflection of my talent, work ethic, or attitude.  I have experienced an unexpected freedom in my coding practice, as I HAVE to fail in order to try at all.  Failure is a good thing in coding; it allows you the ability to dissect what went wrong, fix the issue, and learn by doing.  This has decreased so much pressure I am used to placing on myself in academics.  Failing is fun, failing is necessary, and the freedom it brings has made me love coding that much more!
